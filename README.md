# slang-android

Builds the [Slang](https://shader-slang.org/) shader compiler for Android as a shared library.

There are prebuilt binaries available in [Releases](https://github.com/zeozeozeo/slang-android/releases).

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows 11, you must enable [Developer Mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/advanced-settings/developer-mode) in the Settings app, otherwise the build will fail when Slang tries to create a symlink.
